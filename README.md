# Cnn-Cats-vs-Dogs

* Context: The task is to write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.  
  This is easy for humans, dogs, and cats. Your computer will find it a bit more difficult.
* Packages used are SKLearn, Tenserflow and Keras.
* The CNN is trained to predict 2 classes,  1 neuron and sigmoid is used. 
* It is trained on Colab with 1 GPU. Accuracy is 73% here, as it is trained on partial images,
  we can achieve an accuracy of 98.3% by using whole data.
